Project Abstract

Form.com is a data collection software to create custom web and mobile. The goal of streamlining data collection and digitizing form-based processes. Easily collect data directly from your smart device with or without an internet connection. It integrates deeply customizable data collection tools and business intelligence dashboards. With IT infrastructure to continuously improve the operations. With Form, the user can customize the application to specific use case, process, and desired outcome. Design forms to automate virtually any manual process in an optimized digital environment. Data collection can take pictures, attach files, add notes, make comments, and markup images to highlight specific areas of interest.
 
Project Relevance

The project link to the soft design class in Web development, data collection, refactoring, design patter, and multi-threading. For web development, Form has an advantage of display-responsive layouts which make buttons, text, and interactive elements scale to screen size on any device. In database programming, it’s flexible tools to drill down into the details of collected data and create custom visualizations, like charts and tables. For data collection, Form allows import and export data in a large volume ad convenient format. The format can be in SPSS, PDF, XML, and CSV. Data collection can be done in two ways: by requesting data from Form Application, or by scheduling the delivery of data to a secure FTP location. For multi-threading, Form can run on multiple devices and constant access to previous and new data without merging. With form, data get to save and storage in Form Web. The user doesn’t need to worry about the limit of storage on their devices.

Conceptual Design

For my contribution, I think I could create a feature named Fast Access Remote that benefits to the user. The application is written in Java programming language. With Fast Access remote, users can get a notification on any new data that being changed by others. The user can click on the notification to take them to the page. They can manage and collapse with their colleagues. While working on the data collection, they could exit and the work gets to save. Others who contribute to the same data can also see the notification that someone has been accessed and change the information. Instead of going to the Form Web and change the data, the user can use Fast Access Remote build in the App. It's fast and convenient to allow the user to save their time while working.
